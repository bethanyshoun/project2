# Word Raffle

## Project description
The purpose of this group project was to create a full-stack application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge by using Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as the templating engine, MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database, both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data, and be deployed using Heroku (with data), while using at least one new library, package, or technology, and has a polished user interface.

We decided to make something fun; a social media platform that invites music/song-lyric lovers to join together and test how well they really know lyrics to songs. 

User Story: AS A music lover and song lyric enthusiast I WANT TO create an application that generates random words SO THAT I can test my lyric knowledge and comment lyrics that contain that random word.

### How it Works
Users will:
1. Users create an account or login.
2. Users press a "Generate Random Word" button to reveal a random word from our seeds file.
3. Users enter the random word in an input field and song lyrics that contain that word in another input field then click the "Create Post" button to save. 
4. The user can view all of their personal posts on their dashboard, they can view all users' posts on the home screen (house icon).

### Directions for Future Development
Directions for future development are under production (not currently functional). 
**Update styling and make each section a more distinct page with less scrolling.
Users will be able to:
1. Edit thier own posts.
2. "heart" posts that they like.
3. Comment their own suggested lyrics containing the same random word under the original users' posts.
4. Link the song containing those lyrics to Amazon, Apple Music, or Spotify. 
5. Create different threads for song lyrics, movie quotes, and book quotes based on random words generated.
